# Java-Interpreter

This is a very basic Java Interpreter, based on the grammar file in grammar/JavaGrammar.g4.
Currently names can only consist of lowercase letters, and only `void`, `String` and `int` types are accepted.

This project was made as part of a computer science class in 2023.

## Credits

- [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) is used for scanning and parsing the input.
